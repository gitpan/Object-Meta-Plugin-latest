=head1 NAME

Object::Meta::Plugin::Useful::Greedy - a plugin base class which gobbles up reasonable parts of the symbol table at export time.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	package Foo;

	use base 'Object::Meta::Plugin::Useful::Greedy';

	sub ppretty {
		# ...
	}

	sub ver_pretty {
		# ...
	}

	sub ugly { # will not be exported because of the pattern
		# ...
	}

	sub _filter {
		grep {/pretty/} @_;
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a base class for a pretty standard, pretty easy plugin. When C<export > is called it goes through the symbol table of the plugin's package, as per C<ref $self>, and so forth through all the @ISAs it finds. The functions it finds along the way are collected, and filtered.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item exports

This rummages it's class's symbol table, and returns a list of method names as filtered by C<_filter>.

=item _filter LIST

This takes a list of method names, and munges it into something. The current example will filter things that don't look pretty, that are a bit too general (new, init, croak), and then fishes out duplicates.

You really should define it in your class, if you want more control of the patterns.

=head1 CAVEATS

=over 4

=item *

Does not work on classless objects and such. The plugin in question must be a real set of classes.

=item *

Relies on the non core module L<Devel::Symdump>.

=back

=head1 BUGS

Peh! You must be kididgn!

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item *

Switch @ISA trace to L<Class::ISA>. One more prerequisite can't hurt.
