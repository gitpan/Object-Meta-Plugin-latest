=head1 SYNOPSIS

	package MyFoo;
	use bas "Object::Meta::Plugin::Useful::Generic";

	sub new {
		my $pkg = shift;
		my $self = $pkg->SUPER::new(@_);

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item exports

Returns the list of method names as created by C<export>.

=item export METHODS ...

This method takes a list of method names, and makes sure they are all implemented (C<$self->can($method)>) and so forth. It then makes notes of what remains, and will return these values when the exports method is called by the standard export list implementation.

=head1 CAVEATS

=over 4

=item *

Will emit warnings if lexical warnings are asked for. It will bark when C<$self->can($method)> is not happy. You can suppress it with

	no warnings 'MyFoo';

Or

	no warnings 'Object::Meta::Plugin::Useful::Generic';

Depending on what level you'd like the warnings to be suppressed.
