NAME

Object::Meta::Plugin
    
DESCRIPTION

The Object::Meta::Plugin module provides the means to synthesize an object out
of objects called plugins. These plugins object then interact amongst themselves
either in pretense that they are the host, or knowing of their status as part of
a whole.

The main principal is to provide a minimalistic API which can be used to create
complicated objects from arbitrary parts, as long as the parts agree on what is
exchanged between them.

This is supposed to be a solution for large scale applications, where modularity
and customizability is an issue.

Provided the plugins are well behaved, drop in exchange of various ones should
be very easy.
